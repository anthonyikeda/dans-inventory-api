== Introduction

This is the API that manages all products for Dan's cafe. Products are broken down into 2 main
categories:

* Drinks
* Snacks

This API allows Dan to determine what products are available, how much they cost and how many of the items
he has left available to sell.

Prices for the products can change based on demand, events and the season.
